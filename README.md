###### Simulate depolarizing current pulses of various amplitudes by setting the voltage initial condition to a succession of values positive to the resting potential while starting w at the equilibrium point. 

Action potentials are usually thought to have thresholds. Does the MLE with the
given set of parameters have a threshold depolarization?
